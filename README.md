# SuperVIND: Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamics (with tensorflow)


This code is the tensorflow, augmented implementation for the paper "Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamics", accepted for the Time Series Workshop at NIPS 2017. It represents a sequential variational autoencoder that is able to infer nonlinear dynamics in the latent space. The training algorithm makes use of a novel, two-step technique for optimization based on the [Fixed Point Iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_iteration) method for finding fixed points of iterative equations.

# Installation

The code is written in Python 3.5. You will need the bleeding edge versions of the following packages:

- tensorflow
- seaborn

In addition, up-to-date versions of numpy, scipy and matplotlib are expected.

# Running the code

With the above requirements in place, firing `python runner.py` should work right off the bat. The code will begin finding a two dimensional dynamical system to encode the provided 10D Poisson data. For your convenience, synthetic Gaussian data is also given.
